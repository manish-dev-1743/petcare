                    Together for Paws is run by volunteers who help to treat and transport severely injured dogs in Bhaktapur. This is one of the only dog rescues in Bhaktapur. They have made a huge difference in the area by working alongside some of the other shelters mentioned in this post. They treat dogs on the spot and bring them to shelters nearby if they need further treatment.
